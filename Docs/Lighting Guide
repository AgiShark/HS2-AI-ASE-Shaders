Honey Select 2 StudioNeo Lighting Tutorial.

I decided to write this, since many people struggling with lighting in their scenes.
In fact StudioNeoV2 has Graphicss plugin which is very powerful tools to adjust the visuals.
Since any good raytracing options are not available right now, I'll be using only easily available Directional lights, Point lights and Spot Lights to imitate soft lighting.

Before we start, I wanted to admit some options:
1. Always use Deferred rendering. It supports multiple light sources, and potentially can provide more correct lighting.
2. Color grading. By default the main game and studio using LDR (Low Dynamic Range) colors. Which may looks cartoonish and saturated. 
I always reccomend to switch to HDR - Neutral color preset, and disable all the color corrections. 
With this you will get linear colors and overall cleaner look best for the fresh start the new scene.

For this example I'll be using hooh's Rome Map with baked probs.

First off you need to understand that there is 2 types of lighting:
1. Realtime Lighting (Directional lights, Point lights and Spot Light)
2. Baked Reflection Probes. Which can be tricky to find.
